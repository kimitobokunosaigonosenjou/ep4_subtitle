1
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,490
What?! No way! I swear it
stopped at seven just now!

2
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,200
Looks like no luck for Iska, either.

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,540
You know, I think this machine is rigged.

4
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,790
That's gambling for you.

5
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,660
No! I'm going to the change machine again!

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,660
I have a feeling I'll win next time!

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,370
Wait, Captain! That's what all bad gamblers say!

8
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,410
Will she be all right?

9
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,120
Probably not.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,200
Anyway, what are we doing here
in the first place?

11
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,660
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World

12
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,990
Two weeks ago

13
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,990
Our last vacation?!

14
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:33,200
Yup. Your unit's working under
my orders for the next mission.

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,510
Encounter

16
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,510
The Two Nations Ultimate Weapons

17
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Joint training starts next month,

18
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,540
so go enjoy the time you have left.

19
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,490
Wh-What do you mean by that?!

20
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,330
Anyway, have a good time!

21
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,200
Wait, Risya! Hey, hold on!

22
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,240
Does that mean this mission is really dangerous?

23
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,740
This is so we'll go out with no regrets?

24
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,240
Exactly what is our mission?

25
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,450
She said it's a surprise for next week.

26
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,490
Jeez, you're taking it too literally.

27
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,950
Think about it, Boss.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.

28
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,410
Jhin...

29
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,410
No matter the mission, you'll die when you die.

30
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,660
That's not comforting at all!

31
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,620
N-Now, now.

32
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,910
By the way, why did we choose here?

33
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,660
Jackpot.

34
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,330
"Jackpot"?

35
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,660
As in winning big bucks. But for what?

36
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,580
Merkava tank model MI62,
manufactured by Francesco.

37
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,160
Wait, is that the latest battle tank model?

38
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,200
I wanted to win big at the casino
so I could buy a tank.

39
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,540
That way, even if something happens,
we can all safely escape in it.

40
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,040
I see.

41
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,330
Captain, you're a genius at
coming up with unpredictable ideas.

42
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,330
Well, kudos for not picking
this place for pleasure.

43
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,660
R-Really?! Then I'll keep trying!

44
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,080
Let's go for the jackpot, everyone!

45
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,450
To be our own bosses!
To own a house debt-free!

46
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,160
Your goal just shifted!

47
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,040
We're here, Lady Alice.

48
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,200
This is Jurak, the city of pleasure.

49
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,330
Since early times,
people of nobility have gathered here.

50
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,040
It is a prestigious resort destination,
perfect for Lady Alice.

51
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,490
I'm not interested in gambling.

52
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,200
I made it very clear that I
preferred the Neutral city Ein.

53
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,450
Absolutely not.

54
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,910
Do you want to run into that
Imperial soldier again?!

55
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,080
S-So what if I did?!

56
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,950
My intent is pure. As a princess of Nebulis,
I will fight Iska next time...

57
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:54,540
You can do that on the battlefield.
There's no need to meet him in Neutral city.

58
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,080
Shall we go?

59
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:08,410
What do you think? Slot machines are
perfect for a first-timer such as yourself.

60
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,080
Is that so?

61
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,200
Rin, I think I'll pass.

62
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,830
Not to worry. The goddess of victory
will smile on you, even for gambling.

63
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,330
Victory... That reminds me!

64
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,660
First, I'll need to pick the perfect date
for the battle between me and Iska.

65
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,160
Pick a date?

66
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,410
I wonder what days will work for Iska?

67
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,910
I'm off next week, on Mercurday...

68
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,660
Oh, but the stars show misfortune on that day.
Not good for an important day.

69
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,240
I should pick the next holiday.
I'll also need to reserve a venue...

70
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,080
Lady Alice, this should not
be like planning a wedding.

71
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,330
W-W-W-W-W-W-Wedding?! I-Iska and I?!

72
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,830
Why are you blushing?

73
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,580
Because you said something weird!

74
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,580
Anyway, we can go over that later.

75
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,700
You're right.

76
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,080
I probably won't see him here, anyway.

77
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,700
I can't flip to the Nebulis' side.

78
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,910
Huh? Did the machine break?

79
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,870
Lady Alice, you hit the jackpot!

80
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,990
You should be a lot more excited!

81
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,910
Please wait here while I get the staff!

82
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,490
Hm?

83
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,240
Wow, did you hit the jackpot?! That's amazing!

84
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,330
It is? I don't understand this that well...

85
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,910
If we had this many coins,
I bet we could easily buy Captain's tank.

86
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Take them. I'm afraid this
isn't something I really need.

87
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,330
What?! Are you sure?!

88
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,450
It was meant to be.

89
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,870
Thanks!

90
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,330
Iska!

91
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,040
Someone hit a jackpot over there!
And she shared her winning!

92
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,410
See, Jhin! I told you so.

93
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,330
The jackpot does exist.

94
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,540
Tell it to me again when you hit it.

95
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,870
She must be a generous person.

96
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,910
Probably an oil tycoon?

97
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,120
I don't think so! She was super pretty, too!

98
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,740
Blonde hair and so elegant...
She looked like a princess.

99
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,120
No, it can't be.

100
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,910
Hey, Rin. What's that over there?

101
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,910
It says fortune telling.

102
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,660
Welcome, sweetie.
What would you like me to read?

103
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,160
U-Um, there's a boy a year younger than me...

104
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,790
Oh? Is he your boyfriend?

105
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,410
B-Boyfriend?! N-No, he's not!

106
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,410
Oh, he's not?

107
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,080
Most definitely not.

108
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,370
I want to know when and where
I'll see him again, just the two of us.

109
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,120
Let's see...

110
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:43,120
Hmm... Well this certainly is
an interesting fate.

111
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,790
These cards are a pair of two.

112
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,370
The person you're waiting for is close by.

113
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,450
What?

114
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,580
He is always close by.

115
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,240
You two are connected by a strong bond
that no ill-fate can break.

116
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,370
Right now is the perfect time
if you're looking for somebody.

117
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,120
Lady Alice, how did it go?

118
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,790
She said some plausible things.

119
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,080
But nothing that was specific.

120
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,410
That's fortune telling for you.

121
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,580
Shall we go?

122
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,080
So, what would you like me to read?

123
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,160
I'm looking for someone.

124
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,080
Oh? Perhaps a girlfriend?

125
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,740
Girlfriend?

126
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,370
What's her relationship to you?

127
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:10,080
Uhh... At first, we met on the frontline...
I mean, during our mission.

128
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,700
Ah, so she works with you.

129
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,240
Yes, and then we met again at a theater.

130
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,080
We then ate pasta together,

131
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,330
and then went to the art museum...

132
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,200
Oh, you don't need to go into detail.

133
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,660
Anyway, let's have a look, shall we?

134
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,290
Hmm... Well this certainly is
an interesting fate.

135
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,290
These cards are a pair of two.

136
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,330
The person you're waiting for is close by.

137
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,160
Thank you for coming, Risya.

138
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,370
Let me get straight to the point.
Do you know about the vortex?

139
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,700
Yes, the 47th observation center reported one
just Southwest of Myudol valley.

140
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,950
I thought Nameless was on it already?

141
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,450
It appears we need more reinforcements.

142
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,290
Are you talking about the one in Third Division?

143
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:16,410
Yes, a successor of the Black Steel Gladiator,
Crossweil, would be perfect.

144
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,870
You want me to send Unit N07 to the vortex?

145
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,540
I'll leave the justification up to you.

146
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,200
You want me to ask just because
I'm good friends with Mismis?

147
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,490
Seems I'll be playing the villain for nothing.

148
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,870
That's how you climbed your way up,
pushing aside colleagues and superiors.

149
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,490
I'll do it just this once.

150
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,660
Hey, Unit N07 peeps! Good morning!

151
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,080
Sorry for the early call.

152
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,330
Oh, Risya.

153
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,700
First thing's first. Did you read the details
on next month's training?

154
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,080
Oh, this? Yes, we did.

155
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,450
Well, forget what you read.

156
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,040
Huh?

157
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,620
This call is to inform you about
another mission I'm sending you on.

158
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,540
As you know, this whole witch and
demon thing started 100 years ago,

159
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,990
when a drift of astral energy created
what we call the vortex.

160
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:30,540
Without the vortex, we never would've had
Grand Witch Nebulis or the Sovereignty.

161
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,450
And it looks like another vortex
is going to form.

162
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,080
It'll be a pain if the Sovereignty
gains access to the vortex.

163
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,910
That could mean a more
powerful witch may be born.

164
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,450
That's where you guys, members of Unit N07,
come into play... To stop them.

165
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:53,120
After all, you did perform a feat
of stopping the Ice Calamity Witch.

166
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,790
So, good luck!

167
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,200
I forgot to give this back.

168
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,490
Lady Alice, excuse me.

169
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,080
Just now, I received a message
for you from your sister.

170
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,660
From Sisbell? What is it?

171
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,410
A disruption in astral energy,

172
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,620
possibly a vortex, was observed
at Myudol valley, Southwest of the Sovereignty.

173
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,950
The Empire has sent troops
towards the location.

174
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,700
How could that be?
I was not made aware of this.

175
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,330
The Zoa family... They're intentionally
delaying their report to Her Majesty.

176
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,870
I'll never understand it.

177
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,830
How are the Lou, Zoa, and Hydra families--

178
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,450
the three royal lines--in this much conflict?

179
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,290
Myudol valley is close to the Empire border.

180
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,120
Astral power forces are always stationed there,
which is Zoa's jurisdiction.

181
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,160
If it's not being reported, then...

182
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,790
The Zoa family plans to keep
the vortex energy for themselves?

183
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,450
I believe so.

184
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,790
All right. I'll go find out.

185
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:33,240
Not much of a welcome considering
the queen's daughter is here.

186
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,450
No...

187
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,160
That's close enough, Masked Lord.

188
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,740
Very impressive. You've always had
a heightened sense, Rin.

189
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,160
Anyone could feel your presence
if you just stood behind us like that.

190
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,160
What is the meaning of this, Masked Lord?

191
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,910
It's not what you think.
Please, don't be so alarmed.

192
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:10,160
You see, my astral power is weak,
so I always carry this around out of fear.

193
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,370
So, what brings you here today?

194
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,370
To ask a question about the vortex
in Myudol valley. Why isn't the Zoa--

195
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,490
That's just a flux in the magma,
or perhaps a drift of underground gas.

196
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,370
There's no proof that it's the vortex.

197
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,540
Of course, it would be smart
to send the troops over, just in case.

198
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,410
Then why are you stalling to report?

199
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,950
Zoa's head of the family had left
just now to go report our findings.

200
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,660
It took us a while to prepare the documents.

201
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,240
I see.

202
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,240
It appears this is simply a waste
of time to try and talk about this.

203
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,160
You'd be wise to keep a low profile.

204
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,040
Captain Mismis.

205
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,910
Oh, what's up?

206
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,870
Did you report what happened
at Ein to the higher-ups?

207
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,410
Oh, that. It was quite an ordeal, you know.

208
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,700
"Why don't you have a recording
of the witch?!" they said.

209
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,660
I'm sorry...

210
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,200
It's fine, don't worry!

211
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,120
I get in trouble all the time for report
omissions or mistakes on forms!

212
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,580
Noro!

213
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,450
Over here!

214
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,330
Oh, hey, Mismis!

215
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,870
When did you return to the Third Division?

216
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,370
Just recently.

217
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,910
Let me introduce you.
These are my lovely subordinates!

218
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,120
I'm Shanorotte Gregory.

219
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,870
Mismis and I met each other
when we were low-ranking soldiers.

220
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,830
Although, it doesn't look like
you got any taller.

221
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,910
I did! About 2mm!

222
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,990
Soldiers, line up!

223
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,830
He certainly has a vibe.

224
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,830
Rumors were right.
That's the cutting-edge optical camouflage suit.

225
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,620
Saint Disciple of the eighth seat, Nameless.

226
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,580
He comes from the Empire's Assassination Force.

227
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:48,200
Let me start by telling you that I
will not give you specific orders here.

228
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,450
With that understanding,
your missions are as follows:

229
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,120
One, to secure the vortex
before the Sovereignty does.

230
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,490
Two, to destroy the vortex
if you fail to do so.

231
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,370
Lastly, do not get in my way.

232
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,120
My goal is to crush the astral power forces.

233
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,830
I will not allow anyone to stop me. That is all.

234
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,370
All units, continue searching for the vortex!

235
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,660
Apparently, the vortex is a giant astral energy.

236
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,160
Got anything, Boss?

237
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,910
No, I don't see anything like that.

238
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,540
No readings of astral energy, either.

239
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,490
Noro? What is it?

240
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,660
One of the units searching the vortex is MIA.

241
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,330
We also lost contact with two
other units that went to investigate.

242
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,580
Could it be the Nebulis' astral power force?

243
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,740
If that were the case,
there'd be signs of a struggle.

244
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,660
True.

245
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,950
But no evidence was found.

246
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,700
Either way, we'll head back to base!
They probably have new orders for us.

247
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,910
No need.

248
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,370
Of 32 units, only three are missing.

249
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,240
There's no need to dispatch
a rescue squad just for three units.

250
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,700
Just focus on locating the vortex.

251
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,200
Th-That is all. Dismissed!

252
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,830
Talk about lacking explanation.

253
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,120
It's weird to not send a rescue squad
when over ten people are missing.

254
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,870
Right, Captain?

255
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,410
Is he thinking about abandoning them?
I can't say I agree with that...

256
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,740
I'll go ask. He's my ex-colleague, after all.

257
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,620
Wait, Iska?!

258
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,790
Excuse me.

259
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,830
Wh-Who are you?!

260
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,910
I would like to speak to the commander.

261
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,870
If this is an emergency,
have your captain come to us.

262
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,450
Seems I have an odd guest.

263
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,200
I don't remember your name,
but I've seen you before.

264
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,990
It's been a year.

265
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:14,040
Yes, the traitor of the Empire.
You have some nerve, showing up here.

266
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,910
As a soldier stationed at this base,
I have a question.

267
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:23,080
If you want to speak,
you need the appropriate rank.

268
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,240
Get lost.

269
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,450
U-Um, if that's the case...

270
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,950
I would like to speak on his behalf
as a captain, Saint Disciple, sir.

271
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,740
Captain?!

272
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,200
Sorry, Iska. I'll take it from here.

273
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,040
At least let me be a hero
at a time like this...!

274
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,580
I'm Mismis, captain of
the Third Division Unit N07.

275
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,410
I-I do not mean any disrespect, but...

276
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,580
Why aren't we sending a rescue squad
for the missing soldiers?

277
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,580
And Mr. Saint Disciple didn't say a word?

278
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:07,490
Hmm, I wonder if there's a secret op
we don't know about?

279
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,370
Maybe...

280
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,490
Phew, that was refreshing!

281
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,490
Now, where did I put my cold juice?

282
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,830
Captain, at least your body is mature.

283
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,830
Nooooo!

284
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,200
I-I-It's not what you think!

285
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,870
I was so nervous about what happened today,
and the shower got me relaxed,

286
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,160
a-and, um, so, that's why, uh...

287
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,490
Please calm down, Captain.

288
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,580
No one will ever marry me now!

289
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,870
Jhin, take responsibility!

290
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,540
That doesn't make any sense!

291
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,330
Are you sure about heading to the valley?

292
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,410
Yes, as quickly as possible.

293
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,790
This isn't an excuse to go see that Imperial...

294
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,790
Of course not! Iska wouldn't be there.

295
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,910
I'm going as the princess of the Lou family.

296
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,910
It's time...

297
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,080
...Kissing.
